"a theory declaration dened b oth a many-sorted signature , i.e., a collection of sorts and sorted function symb ols, and a theory with that signature." (Barrett et al 2010:25)


"except that they may declare entire families of overloaded function symb ols by using ranks that contain sort" (Barrett et al 2010:25)
"parameters, lo cally scop ed sort symb ols of arity 0. Additionally, a theory declaration now generally denes a class of similar theories|as opp osed to a single theory as in Version 1.2." (Barrett et al 2010:26)
"Theory attributes can b e formal or informal dep ending on whether or not their value has a formal semantics and can b e pro cessed in principle automatically." (Barrett et al 2010:26)
"The eect of this attribute is to declare that the logic{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s sort and function symb ols consist of those of the combined theory T , and that the logic{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s semantics is restricted to the mo dels of T , as sp ecied in more detail in Section 4.5." (Barrett et al 2010:33)
"In the context of a command script the language of a logic is implicitly expanded by let constructs in formulas as well as user-dened sort and function symb ols." (Barrett et al 2010:34)
"can b e given a unique sort only if f is annotated with one of the result sorts 1 ; : : : ; n , that is, only if it is written as f i for some i 2 fi; : : : ; ng." (Barrett et al 2010:46)
"e sp ecic signature is jointly dened by the declaration of T plus any additional sort and function symb ol declarations contained in the script." (Barrett et al 2010:46)
"For each signature , the language of SMT-LIB logic is the set of all well-sorted terms wrt . Formulas are well-sorted terms of sort Bo ol." (Barrett et al 2010:47)
"SMT-LIB scripts consider only closed formulas, or sentences , closed terms of sort Bo ol.( 17 )" (Barrett et al 2010:47)
"alternative way to avoid free variables in scripts is to replace them by fresh constant symb ols of the same sort. This is again with no loss of generality b ecause, for satisability mo dulo theories purp oses, a formula{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s free variables can b e treated equivalently as free symbols (see later for a denition)." (Barrett et al 2010:47)

Sorts map to values. e.g. Ints maps to all integers, Bool maps to True and False (note on p.48) 



"each 2 Sort () as subset A of A, with Bo olA = B ," (Barrett et al 2010:48)

Constant maps to a value (note on p.48) 



"each (ranked function symb ol) f : 2 as an element (f : )A of A ," (Barrett et al 2010:48)}
